Bugs when testing:
1.common errors:- Common errors are generated while sync for resource. These errors should be reflected. currently the 
solution use id field for collecting common errors.

2.What is the use case when user create resource and then login and then sync
When first user login
a)Delete unsyncronized data/import
When first user logout
b)use guest user id
when second user login
keep the first user sync data and delete unsync data of first user.
only fetch shared resources
c)If no user logged in the offline data should not be populated.
Currently, when sync without user, the offline data like added, deleted, updated in memory are cleared.
but offline resource is sent.


3.Consider other diff usecases like above

4.The width of ion-item get reduced while using virtual itex`m

5.Faouriable scenerio: Need to decide wether user has to be on-line or not.
Then how to re make the association in server when resource id changes for new item

6.user_id not set in local cache

7.browser_adapter.js:84 TypeError: Cannot read property 'resize' of undefined
